## Technical Decisions

### Audio Recording
- **Library**: `expo-av` (Audio.Recording)
- **Format**: AAC/M4A for iOS, 3GP for Android
- **Quality**: High quality for better transcription
- **Max Duration**: 60 seconds (configurable)

### Speech-to-Text
- **Web**: Web Speech API (Chrome/Edge only)
- **Native (Production)**: `@react-native-voice/voice`
  - iOS: Apple Speech Recognition Framework
  - Android: Google Speech Recognition
- **Development**: Demo mode with random Italian transcripts
- **Fallback**: Server-side transcription for low confidence
- **Locale**: Default to `it-IT`, configurable per venue (it-IT, en-US, en-GB, es-ES)

### State Management
- **Local State**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- **Global Context**: For user/venue metadata and feature flags
- **AsyncStorage**: For feature toggle and settings persistence
- **React Query**: For API calls and caching

### Permissions
- **iOS**: `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`, `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription`
- **Android**: `RECORD_AUDIO`, `INTERNET` (for fallback)

## Audio File Management

### Storage Locations
- **iOS**: `Library/Caches/ExponentExperienceData/@narcofreccia/tide-booking-app/AV/recording-{UUID}.m4a`
- **Android**: `cache/ExperienceData/%2540narcofreccia%252Ftide-booking-app/AV/recording-{UUID}.m4a`
- **Web**: Blob URLs (temporary)

### Lifecycle
1. **Created**: When recording starts
2. **Stored**: Temporarily in app cache
3. **Used**: 
   - High confidence (≥70%): Transcript only, audio discarded
   - Low confidence (<70%): Audio uploaded to server for recheck
4. **Deleted**: 
   - Automatically by OS when cache is cleared
   - By backend after processing (14-30 days retention)
   - TODO: Add manual cleanup in app

### Current Behavior
- ✅ Audio files are created and stored
- ✅ Audio URI included in result when `needsServerRecheck: true`
- ✅ Uploaded to server when confidence < 70%
- ✅ Backend handles cleanup (14-30 days retention)
- ⏳ Client-side cleanup to be added (optional enhancement)

## Notes
- Ensure microphone permissions are requested before recording
- Handle platform differences (iOS vs Android vs Web)
- Consider battery usage for long recordings
- Implement proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Test in noisy environments (restaurant setting)
- Feature should be disabled by default until permissions are granted
- Show clear permission instructions for users
- Respect user privacy - add clear notice about voice processing
- Detection works across all languages regardless of selected app language
